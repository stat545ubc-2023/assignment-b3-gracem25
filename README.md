# Palmer Penguins Body Mass Shiny App Development

This repository contains the code for the Shiny app Palmer Penguins Body Mass, which can be found at https://gracem25.shinyapps.io/assignment-b3-gracem25/

This Shiny app uses the shiny, tidyverse, palmerpenguins and DT packages.

Data credit goes to the developers of the palmerpenguins package, as I used the penguins dataset in my Shiny app. Credit to:  Horst AM, Hill AP, Gorman KB (2020). palmerpenguins: Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) penguin data. R package version 0.1.0. https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/. doi: 10.5281/zenodo.3960218.

This app explores penguin body mass of the three species of penguin within the penguins dataset: Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo. Users are able to filter the data they view by island, and the data is presented in both a boxplot of body mass by species and also an interactive table that explores the data for each individual penguin filtered by island as well. An image shows to the users what each of the three penguin species in the dataset looks like.
